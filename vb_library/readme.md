this folder contains vba modules for version control, publishing and registering of your valid documents and exporting values to the assistant. the documents will retrieve their vba code from here as they natively contain not much more than import functions and basic settings of language and relative path to this folder as of january 2020 (major refactoring!).
after import modules are installed and only overwritten if the remote files are found next time opening.

the files are prepared to work on their own if no import file is found. supplying the source folder has the benefit of changes affecting all working draft documents automatic. be careful as well as glad changes have to be only done in one location mostly. yay!
