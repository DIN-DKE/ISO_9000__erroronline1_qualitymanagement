	// but ended up thinking this might be a good idea to customize the name of the startup-file
	// according to your language and intention. in some cases it is easier to explain to some
	// coworkers. if there are changes to the main file all you have to do is to update the 
	// location destination so on this file will be likely to point to the latest version and
	// you do not necessarily have to update all set shortcuts
